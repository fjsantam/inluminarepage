## Inluminare has a custom, innovative approach to input evaluation. 
### What's an input?
#### *(Don't forget the yummy pasta recipe at the link below* ðŸ˜‹*)*

At [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/), we refer to inputs as what is consumed during a process to achieve a desired output. These inputs, in turn, reflect the resources used during that specific process. For example, if I am making a tomato sauce,

* the output is the completed, ready-to-eat sauce,
* the process is assembling the ingredients, cooking, and mixing as appropriate, and
* the inputs are the ingredients, the recipe, the various cooking tools, and other knowledge about what makes a really delicious tomato sauce (we recommend the three-ingredient recipe, check out our link below to learn more!).

When we want to understand how much we spent on achieving our desired tomato sauce (or a different output) and what are some adjustments we can make to have it be even tastier, having a complete catalogue of all of the inputs allows us to make refined, targeted decisions about areas of improvement for the future.

Our approach of looking back to look forward is something new in the spaces of performance evaluation as well as process improvement. We explain more about why our approach is so unique at the link below, as well as in our next post.
