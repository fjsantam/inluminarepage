"Inluminare sheds light on the resources you need for success." 
======

**WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?** (P.S. yummy pasta recipe at the link below üòã)

Let's start by breaking down, what is a resource? A lot of thoughtful authors have compiled definitions - I personally like Barney's list in their 1991 article. But, for the sake of non-academics, let's compress that information into something more accessible.

At [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/), we define a resource as an asset controlled by a firm, or everything that an organization controls and uses in the process of delivering some kind of desired output. This includes physical items and buildings, employee knowledge and skills, and how your organization is set up to be successful.

We try to get as precise as possible: specific skillsets over job titles, brand names and model numbers over ‚Äújust an oven.‚Äù This allows us to tease apart which resources were most important for your success and which could be replaced to improve your outputs.

How does this information tie into what your organization actually produces or does? You can find out more at the link below, or wait for our next post!
