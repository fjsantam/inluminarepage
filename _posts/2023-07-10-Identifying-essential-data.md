## Inluminare helps you identify essential, often overlooked data key to improving performance. 

### Ok, like what? 

#### *(And did you try the tomato sauce recipe yet at the link below?)*

Here at [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/), we think of performance measurement as a way for us to understand how much did it cost to produce a unit of output (or efficiency) and how close or far away did we get to producing what we actually intended (or efficacy). A common, even dominant way to understand these performances is through analyzing processes. 

There are many tools that focus principally (and some exclusively) on processes that also address inputs and resources, but all leave something to be desired. For example, a SIPOC diagram is a way to visually capture how we produce a pizza, but because the focus is on the process, the full range of necessary inputs is often left unaddressed. In fact, the common guidance when creating a SIPOC diagram is to focus on the raw, physical goods that are most important to your process!

In the diagram at the link below, you can see how a SIPOC diagram and similar tools can be instrumental in helping you begin the process of what resources you will need to produce a particular output. But, as we see in the red box, we lose detail in identifying all of our resources. It could also be that there is another essential resource that we should include, but we will only discover this once we have actually made the sauce ‚Äì such as a sauce pan!

For nonprofits and government agencies, a similar tool is used before starting a project to establish an expected ‚Äútheory of change,‚Äù or what needs to happen in order for something in society to be different. This is often referred to as a logic model, a visual representation of the various relationships between our inputs, processes, outputs, and desired short- and long-term outcomes.

At the link below, we show how logic model best practices capture how resources are the first step in any effort to produce outputs and achieve some kind of outcome. At the same time, it is only meant to capture ‚Äúcertain,‚Äù major resources ‚Äì ones that are obvious beforehand but, again, may not prove to be as important in retrospect.

So, [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/), when is the best time to do this input evaluation and get some resource portfolios for my programs, services, and lines of business? We cover that at the link below, as well as in our next post üòé .
