## Inluminare helps you learn from past resource deployments to have a more successful tomorrow. 
### Why does the past help me tomorrow?!
#### *(Final reminder about the amazing tomato sauce recipe at the link below!* üçÖ üçù *)*

At [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/), we refer to inputs as what is consumed during a process to achieve a desired output. These inputs, in turn, reflect the resources used during that specific process. For example, if I am making a tomato sauce,


[Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/) breaks the mold by bringing together planning for the future and evaluation the past and present. The two tools that we discussed earlier and at the link below, logic models and SIPOC diagrams, have something in common, along with many other, similar methods: they take place as part of the planning before the work gets done. What inputs are necessary to produce intended outputs is driven by historical knowledge ‚Äì knowledge that we bring from similar efforts, previous employments, or past versions of this process.

A critical component of organizational learning is to understand what is happening in real time and after the fact, to monitor and evaluate, and to collect data and insights to inform future decisions. These actions provide critical opportunities to reduce costs and be more effective, while also increasing efficacy through getting closer to producing our ideal output ‚Äì from a watery, burnt tomato sauce to one rich in flavor. This is where [Inluminare](https://inluminare.co/) shines. We provide you insights on the resources that you used and intend to use again, focused on:

* Fair market valuation: what is the price someone would pay for the resource in a competitive marketplace? This is the number that important standards-setting organizations want to see.

* Non-financial valuation: you can choose from a number of different ways to rank, measure, and categorize resources, to gain insights on what is truly essential versus what is just expensive to acquire.

We generate our insights at the level of individual programs, services, or lines of business, to provide you with data that is immediately actionable and not just part of future planning efforts.

Reach out today to explore how we can partner with you - and enjoy the sauce recipe!
