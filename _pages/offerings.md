To build your resource portfolio for a single program or service, or resource inventory for multiple, we take a holistic approach that leverages quantitative and qualitative data. This data will include financial documentation and reports as well as interviewing staff members to answer the question, just what *were* the resources that you used? 

Oftentimes, how we think of a “resource” can be limited by the perceived difficulty in measuring it. For this reason, we offer both financial valuations as well as a range of non-financial valuations of your resources, all in the service of achieving our mission and vision.

Our default offering is the creation of the resource portfolio for one of your programs or services, which includes financial valuations as well as your choice of non-financial valuations. We offer virtual and in-person services to build the portfolio. 

Additional analyses are available upon request, including:
* Portfolio review focused on efficiency and efficacy gains 
    * We summarize trends within and across different classes of resources within the portfolio    
    * We identify potential threats to your ability to repeat the offering
* Review of resource alignment with internal guidance documents, such as strategic plans and logic models
* Cost benefit and break even analyses
* Evaluations of offering performance relative to resources used
