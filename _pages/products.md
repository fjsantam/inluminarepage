## Váles
### What it does
It takes the challenge out of estimating monetary value for even hard-to-measure resources, such as contributed services, using machine learning and discriminative AI.  
*What number should I assign to a donated good or service that we have never received before?*

###	How it will help
Nonprofits can improve financial compliance by easily calculating fair market valuations for all kinds of resources. Váles replaces the need to reinvent the wheel and make new methods for financial valuations, while allowing nonprofits to report more accurate and detailed financial data.  
*How can I systematically and consistently assign values to this kind of resource going forward?*

###	How it does it
It uses machine learning and discriminative AI to take provided descriptions and produce reliable estimates of their financial value. Using these estimates and existing data, such as inventory or hours received, nonprofits can more accurately calculate how much of a given resource was used.  
*Given the amount we used and the cost per unit, what’s the value of the consumed resources?*

###	What to expect after using it
With fuller financial data, key insights such as cost-benefit analyses and financial ratios can be even more accurate. In addition, users’ financial statements will be more aligned with standards and best practices that require the reporting of donated goods and services at fair market values. Data from Váles can greatly enhance the analytic opportunities offered by Reta.  
*What was the total cost to deliver the program, now that we have values for even the hard-to-measure resources?*


## Reta
### What it does
It builds on nonprofits’ existing data to capture the range of resources used to deliver programs, even ones that are hard to measure financially. It also shows monetary and non-monetary values of those resources.  
*How important was a particular resource, and how much did it cost?*

###	How it will help
By creating a resource portfolio that reflects the resources used to deliver a program, organizations can understand resource value beyond just financial data.  
*What was the most important resource when I consider its cost as only one of multiple factors?*

###	How it does it
Reta categorizes and assigns meaningful values to the resources used by nonprofits. By using research-derived categories, users can indicate which resources are most important across multiple dimensions. This allows users to run meaningful reports that go beyond the numbers. It also incorporates Váles to let users assign monetary value to resources not captured in their existing financial data.  
*When I think about a resource from another perspective, what value would I assign it?*

### What to expect after using it
With a completed resource portfolio for a program, nonprofits and foundations will be able to determine what was necessary for that program’s success, how to ensure its sustainability in the future, what are essential resources and varying costs that would be associated with scaling up, and better direct strategic planning and development efforts to secure essential resources, both now and in the future. They can also perform more accurate and comprehensive performance evaluations to better calculate returns per dollar spent, the scale of their impact, and financial ratios such as program-expense ratios.  
*What resources do I need to secure to make this program work somewhere else?*
