## Reta

#### What it does
It builds on nonprofits’ existing data to capture the range of resources used to deliver programs, even ones that are hard to measure financially. It also shows monetary and non-monetary values of those resources.  
*How important was a particular resource, and how much did it cost?*

####	How it will help
By creating a resource portfolio that reflects the resources used to deliver a program, organizations can understand resource value beyond just financial data.  
*What was the most important resource when I consider its cost as only one of multiple factors?*

####	How it does it
Reta categorizes and assigns meaningful values to the resources used by nonprofits. By using research-derived categories, users can indicate which resources are most important across multiple dimensions. This allows users to run meaningful reports that go beyond the numbers. It also incorporates Váles to let users assign monetary value to resources not captured in their existing financial data.  
*When I think about a resource from another perspective, what value would I assign it?*

#### What to expect after using it
With a completed resource portfolio for a program, nonprofits and foundations will be able to determine what was necessary for that program’s success, how to ensure its sustainability in the future, what are essential resources and varying costs that would be associated with scaling up, and better direct strategic planning and development efforts to secure essential resources, both now and in the future. They can also perform more accurate and comprehensive performance evaluations to better calculate returns per dollar spent, the scale of their impact, and financial ratios such as program-expense ratios.  
*What resources do I need to secure to make this program work somewhere else?*
