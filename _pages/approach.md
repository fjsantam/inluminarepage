# Our Values

At Inluminare, we have certain values:

1. **Transformation**: Whenever we take on a project, we intend to improve our clients' situation, as well as those of their stakeholders. At minimum, we want leave our clients no worse off than they were before. Like in camping: always leave your campsite better than you found it.
2. **Education** & **Communication**: Everything we do is intended to yield actionable insights that can be shared among partners as well as to the wider community - there is nothing new under the sun, and so what benefits one can surely benefit another. A rising tide raises all ships, and the more we educate and communicate key findings, the better everyone is, especially those organizations operating under difficult conditions (economic, systemic marginalization, environmental, etc.).
3. **Investigation**: Founded by a PhD, we strive to keep that curious instinct alive by continuing to ask of ourselves and our partners, "is this working?" "What can we do better?" "How can we improve?"

We firmly believe that our multi-dimensional approach that leverages inductive, deductive, and predictive data, through 
* Inductively deriving insights by working with your staff and reviewing your historical data
* Deductively crafting hypotheses given what we know about your work
* Predicting additional values and data insights using statistical and machine learning tools
