This map is generated from a [Jupyter Notebook/Lab file](https://github.com/fjsantam/fjsantam.github.io/tree/master/_presentations) (source file [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)), which mines the location fields in the .md files in \_presentations.

For more information on the presentations that I gave at each location, please visit my [CV](/cv/) and [presentations](/presentations/) pages.
